*Solanum tuberosum* "Diacol capiro" HiFi genome assembly
=

The pipelines were built in the project resolving the genome of a tetraploid potato from the Andigenum group, the cultivar Diacol capiro. Most of the scripts were sepcially designed to perform the analyses in the paper 'Chromosome-scale genome assembly of the tetraploid potato cultivar Diacol Capiro from the Andigenum group' (under review).

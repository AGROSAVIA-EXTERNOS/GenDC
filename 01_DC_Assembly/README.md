Diacol Capiro draft genome assembly
=

The HiFi reads were run into multiplede novoassemblers such as:
- [Flye](https://github.com/fenderglass/Flye) 
- [HiCanu](https://github.com/marbl/canu)
- [Hifiasm](https://github.com/chhylp123/hifiasm)
- [IPA](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/pbipa)

The selected assembly was obtained with HiCanu based on most of the metrics such as BUSCO score, N50, L50, total length, largest contig and total contigs evaluated by QUAST v5.0.2

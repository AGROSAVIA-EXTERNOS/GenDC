ALLHiC Phasing & Scaffolding
=

Phasing and  Scaffolding was performed in several Strategies, using ALLHiC pipeline: 

- Strategy 0: Phasing and scaffolding with RH89-039-16 v3 potato assembly as reference, Canu draft assembly v1 and raw HiC reads.
- Strategy 1: Phasing and scaffolding with RH89-039-16 v3 potato assembly as reference, Canu draft assembly v2(corrected with raw HiC reads) and raw HiC reads.

### Strategy 2
Phasing and scaffolding with RH89-039-16 v3 potato assembly as reference, Canu draft assembly v2(corrected with raw HiC reads) and HiC valid contacts.

### Strategy 3
Phasing and scaffolding with RH89-039-16 v3 potato assembly as reference, Canu draft assembly v1 and HiC valid contacts.

### Strategy 4
Phasing and scaffolding with RH89-039-16 v3 potato assembly as reference, Canu draft assembly v3(corrected with HiC valid contacts) and HiC valid contacts.

### Strategy 5
Phasing and scaffolding with DMv6 potato assembly as reference, Canu draft assembly v1 and HiC valid contacts.

### Strategy 6
Phasing and scaffolding with DMv6 potato assembly as reference, Canu draft assembly v2(corrected with raw HiC reads) and HiC valid contacts.

### Strategy 7
Phasing and scaffolding with DMv6 potato assembly as reference, Canu draft assembly v3(corrected with HiC valid contacts) and HiC valid contacts
